This is a beginning of the JunkJungle game. The game is in an early phase of
development, so it's not playable yet. You can check the most recent version at
http://sheep.art.pl/JunkJungle

You need Python (http://python.org) to run it, as well
as Pygame (http://pygame.org), a Python library.

Either double-click the junk.py file, or run: python junk.py
